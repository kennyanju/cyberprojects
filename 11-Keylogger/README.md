# Keylogger (Educational Use Only)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how keylogging works using Python and the `pynput` library. It captures keystrokes and logs them to a file.

## Project Structure

- `scripts/`: Python script for capturing keystrokes.
- `docs/`: Notes and precautions for ethical use.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install pynput

```bash
pip install pynput
```

### 2. Run the Keylogger Script

```bash
python3 scripts/keylogger.py
```

Keystrokes will be logged into `keylog.txt`.

## Azure Relevance

In Azure security labs, simulated keyloggers help red teams test detection capabilities. Azure Sentinel can detect abnormal keyboard behavior using analytic rules and behavioral analytics.

## Disclaimer

Use **only in a controlled environment**. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

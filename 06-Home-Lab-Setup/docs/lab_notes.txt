# Lab Setup Notes

- **Network Isolation:** Always isolate lab networks from production and personal networks to prevent accidental exposure or interference.
- **Snapshots & Backups:** Take VM snapshots and regular backups before major experiments or configuration changes. This allows quick recovery from mistakes or attacks.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Use Azure Budgets and Cost Management to monitor cloud usage and avoid unexpected charges.
- **Access Control:** Restrict remote access to lab systems using firewalls, NSGs, or VPNs. Only allow trusted IPs where possible.
- **Documentation:** Keep detailed notes of your lab topology, configurations, and any changes made. This helps with troubleshooting and reproducibility.
- **Automation:** Use scripts and templates (e.g., Bash, Python, PowerShell, Terraform, ARM, Bicep) for consistent and repeatable deployments.
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Leverage provided scripts in Bash, Python, and PowerShell to automate setup and management across different operating systems.
- **Cleanup:** Regularly review and delete unused resources to save costs and reduce attack surface.
- **Security Updates:** Keep all lab systems and software up to date to minimize vulnerabilities.

# WAF Demo Notes

- Web Application Firewalls (WAF) block common web exploits such as SQL injection (SQLi), cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.
- Azure WAF supports custom rules and OWASP-based managed rulesets for enhanced protection.
- Example attack simulation scripts are provided in Bash (`test_attacks.sh`), PowerShell (`test_attacks.ps1`), and Python (`test_attacks.py`) for multi-platform testing.
- Enable logging and alerting in Azure Sentinel to monitor and investigate traffic anomalies or blocked attacks.
- Regularly review WAF logs and tune rules to balance security and usability.

# Threat Intelligence Integration Notes

- Threat Intelligence (TI) feeds provide IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) such as malicious IP addresses, domains, URLs, and file hashes.
- Integrating TI feeds enables automated detection, enrichment, and response to threats in your environment.
- Azure Sentinel can ingest TI feeds via the Graph Security API, direct file uploads, or custom connectors.
- Use TI to enrich security alerts, automate triage, and block or investigate suspicious activity.
- Example scripts are provided in Python, PowerShell, and Bash to demonstrate matching log data against threat feeds.
- Regularly update and validate your TI sources to ensure accuracy and relevance.

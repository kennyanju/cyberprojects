# Malware Analysis Lab

## Overview

This project introduces static and basic dynamic malware analysis using a benign Python script that mimics common malware behaviors for educational purposes.

## Project Structure

- `samples/`: Contains the benign sample to analyze.
- `scripts/`: Analysis scripts and emulation tools.
- `docs/`: Notes on tools, indicators, and methodologies.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Static Analysis

Open the sample file in a text editor or use a tool like `strings`:

```bash
strings samples/fake_malware.py
```

### 2. Run Dynamic Analysis (Simulated)

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_sample.py
```

## Azure Relevance

Azure Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Sentinel are used for real-world malware detection and analysis. This lab simulates basic concepts for training purposes.

## Disclaimer

This sample is benign and intended for learning only.

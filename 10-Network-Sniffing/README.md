# Network Sniffing Lab

## Overview

This project demonstrates basic network sniffing using Python and the `scapy` library. It captures and displays network packets from the default interface.

## Project Structure

- `scripts/`: Python packet sniffer.
- `docs/`: Notes and learning resources.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Scapy

```bash
pip install scapy
```

### 2. Run the Packet Sniffer

```bash
sudo python3 scripts/sniffer.py
```

## Azure Relevance

Monitoring network traffic is critical in cloud environments. Azure Network Watcher and Defender for Cloud provide packet-level insights and threat detection capabilities.

## Disclaimer

Use only on networks you are authorized to monitor. Unauthorized sniffing is illegal.

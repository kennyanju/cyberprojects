# Network Sniffing Notes

- Use tools like Wireshark or scapy to analyze network traffic.
- Packet capture can reveal cleartext data, protocols, and malicious activity.
- On Azure, consider enabling Network Watcher and NSG Flow Logs for insights.
- Always capture traffic with proper permissions in ethical contexts.

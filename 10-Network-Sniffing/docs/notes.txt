# Network Sniffing Notes

- Use tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, tshark, or scapy to analyze network traffic.
- Example packet sniffer scripts are provided in Python (`sniffer.py`), PowerShell (`sniffer.ps1`), and Bash (`sniffer.sh`) for multi-platform demonstrations.
- Packet capture can reveal cleartext data, protocols, and malicious activity.
- On Azure, consider enabling Network Watcher and NSG Flow Logs for insights into cloud network traffic.
- Always capture traffic with proper permissions and only in ethical, authorized contexts.
- Review and filter captured data to protect sensitive information and maintain privacy.

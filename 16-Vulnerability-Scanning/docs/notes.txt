# Vulnerability Scanning Notes

- Use tools like `nmap`, `OpenVAS`, or commercial solutions such as Nessus for vulnerability scans.
- Example scanning scripts are provided in Bash (`scan_ports.sh`), PowerShell (`scan_ports.ps1`), and Python (`scan_ports.py`) for multi-platform automation.
- Always perform scans within authorized boundaries and obtain explicit permission before scanning any network or system.
- Azure Defender and Qualys integration provide built-in vulnerability assessments for Azure resources.
- Regularly review scan results, remediate findings, and re-scan to verify fixes.

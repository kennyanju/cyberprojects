# Vulnerability Scanning

## Overview

This project introduces the basics of vulnerability scanning using tools like `nmap`. It includes scripts to scan for open ports and known vulnerabilities on a target. Multi-platform scripts are provided for Bash, PowerShell, and Python to support automation across different environments.

---

## Project Structure

- `scripts/`: Scanning scripts in Bash, PowerShell, and Python.
  - `scan_ports.sh`: Bash script for automated port scanning.
  - `scan_ports.ps1`: PowerShell script for automated port scanning.
  - `scan_ports.py`: Python script for automated port scanning.
- `targets/`: List of simulated targets (for testing purposes).
- `docs/`: Notes on scanning tools and methodologies.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prepare Target List

Edit `targets/target_list.txt` and add one IP address or hostname per line.

---

### 2. Run Basic Port Scan

**Bash:**
```bash
bash scripts/scan_ports.sh
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
pwsh scripts/scan_ports.ps1
```

**Python:**
```bash
python3 scripts/scan_ports.py
```

Each script will scan the targets listed in `targets/target_list.txt` using `nmap` and print the results.

## Azure Relevance

Vulnerability scanning is essential for maintaining cloud security posture. Azure Defender and Qualys integration provide built-in vulnerability assessments for Azure resources. Regular scanning helps identify and remediate risks before they can be exploited.

---

## Best Practices

- Always perform scans within authorized boundaries and obtain explicit permission before scanning any network or system.
- Regularly review scan results, remediate findings, and re-scan to verify fixes.
- Use automated scripts for consistency and efficiency in scanning tasks.

## Disclaimer

Scan only authorized systems. Unauthorized scanning may be illegal.

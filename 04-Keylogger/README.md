# Keylogger (For Educational & Authorized Lab Use Only)

## Overview

This project provides a simple keylogger implemented in Python. The tool captures keystrokes and logs them to a file for analysis. It is intended strictly for educational, research, and authorized security testing purposesâ€”**never for unauthorized or malicious use**.

> **Warning:** Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Only use this tool in controlled environments with explicit written permission.

## Project Structure

- **`scripts/`**: Contains the Python keylogger script.
- **`docs/`**: Notes, usage guidance, and references.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pynput library**: For capturing keyboard events.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python package:

```bash
pip install pynput
```

### 2. Run the Keylogger

Start the keylogger script:

```bash
python3 scripts/keylogger.py
```

- All keystrokes will be logged to `keylog.txt` in the current directory.
- Stop the script with `Ctrl+C`.

## Example Use Case

- **Security Labs:** Demonstrate the risks of endpoint compromise and the importance of endpoint security controls.
- **Red Team Exercises:** Simulate attacker techniques in a safe, isolated environment.
- **Research:** Study keystroke logging and detection methods.

---

## Azure Relevance

- Deploy in Azure virtual machines or desktops for lab simulations.
- Forward `keylog.txt` to Azure Log Analytics or Microsoft Sentinel for monitoring and detection exercises.

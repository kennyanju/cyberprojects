# Forensic Analysis Notes

- **Disk Images:** Use `.img` files to simulate real-world forensic scenarios and practice analysis techniques.
- **Common Tools:**
  - `fls` — List files and directories within a disk image.
  - `icat` — Extract files from a disk image by inode number.
  - `tsk_recover` — Recover deleted files from a disk image.
  - `foremost` — Carve files from raw disk images based on file signatures.
- **Automation Scripts:**
  - `recover_deleted_files.sh` — Bash script to automate file recovery from a disk image using `foremost`.
  - `recover_deleted_files.py` — Python script to automate file recovery from a disk image using `foremost`.
  - `recover_deleted_files.ps1` — PowerShell script to automate file recovery from a disk image using `foremost`.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Always maintain a strict chain of custody for evidence.
  - Work on copies of disk images, never the original.
  - Document every action and command used during analysis for reproducibility and legal integrity.

## Example Commands

- `fls -r -m / sample.img` — Recursively list all files and directories in the image.
- `icat sample.img <inode>` — Extract a specific file by its inode number.
- `tsk_recover sample.img output_dir/` — Recover files to a specified directory.
- `foremost -i sample.img -o output_dir/` — Carve files from the image into an output directory.
- `bash scripts/recover_deleted_files.sh sample-data/sample.img recovery_output` — Run the Bash recovery script.
- `python3 scripts/recover_deleted_files.py sample-data/sample.img recovery_output` — Run the Python recovery script.
- `pwsh scripts/recover_deleted_files.ps1 -ImagePath sample-data/sample.img -OutputDir recovery_output` — Run the PowerShell recovery script.

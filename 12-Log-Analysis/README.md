# Log Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates log analysis using Python. It parses system logs to identify failed login attempts and other suspicious activity.

## Project Structure

- `scripts/`: Python scripts for parsing logs.
- `logs/`: Sample system log files.
- `docs/`: Notes and references.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. View and Analyze Sample Logs

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_logs.py
```

## Azure Relevance

Log analysis is essential for security monitoring. In Azure, similar log processing occurs in Azure Monitor and Microsoft Sentinel. This project simulates that at a basic level.

## Disclaimer

These logs are simulated. Always follow privacy and compliance requirements when analyzing logs in real environments.
